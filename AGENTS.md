# Project Agents Contract

## Mission

Build an AI-assisted learning workspace where code generation and teaching happen together. Every meaningful code change should also produce a short explanation of:

- what changed
- why it changed
- which concept it teaches
- what to practice next

## Strategic Base

Use the following external repositories as inspiration, not as blind dependencies:

- `engram`: primary reference for persistent memory and context retrieval
- `gentleman-architecture-agents`: pattern for `AGENTS.md`, scope control, and framework-specific agent behavior
- `Gentle-Learning`: reference for educational UX and multi-agent teaching workflows
- `Gentleman-MCP`: future integration layer, not the initial base

Current decision: treat `engram` as the core repo to emulate for memory/context architecture.

## Product Goals

1. Teach while coding.
2. Attach language-aware skills to each implementation flow.
3. Reduce context-window noise before sending code, docs, memories, or logs to an LLM.
4. Keep the context packet small, relevant, and pedagogically useful.

## Agent Operating Rules

1. Explain intent before large edits.
2. Prefer short context packets over raw dumps.
3. Prioritize code, tests, specs, and durable decisions over chat residue.
4. Suppress duplicated snippets, verbose logs, and stale discussion.
5. When teaching, move from concept to code to exercise.
6. End substantial tasks with a brief "what you learned" recap.

## Teaching Loop

For every implementation task, try to produce these artifacts in the final answer:

1. `Change`: what changed in the codebase.
2. `Reason`: why this approach was chosen.
3. `Concepts`: 1-3 ideas the user should retain.
4. `Practice`: a tiny follow-up exercise or question.

## Context Noise Cancellation Rules

Before building a prompt or handing context to another agent:

1. Canonicalize input chunks.
2. Score each chunk by relevance, certainty, recency, and teaching value.
3. Penalize redundancy aggressively.
4. Compress oversized chunks by keeping focus-heavy sentences.
5. Keep an explicit record of what was suppressed and why.

## Preferred Context Sources

Highest priority:

- current task
- edited files
- tests touching the same behavior
- architectural decisions
- durable memory summaries

Lower priority:

- raw logs
- repeated stack traces
- exploratory chat
- generated files without semantic value

## Repository Map

- `README.md`: project overview
- `docs/repo-analysis.md`: decision on which Gentleman-Programming repo to use as base
- `docs/context-noise-cancellation.md`: mathematical and architectural design
- `src/context/noise-canceler.js`: scoring, deduplication, compression
- `src/learning/mentor-loop.js`: teaching packet builder
- `skills/`: language-specific teaching skills

## Current Runtime Constraint

This workspace currently has Node.js available. Python and Go are not available in the shell, so the initial prototype should stay runnable with plain Node.
