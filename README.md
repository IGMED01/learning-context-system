# Learning Context System

Learning Context System (LCS) is a CLI for **coding with teaching, memory, and context control in the same workflow**.

> Spanish summary available in [README.es.md](README.es.md).

It does three things together:

1. selects useful context
2. teaches from that context
3. remembers durable decisions through Engram

## Naming convention (NEXUS)

- **NEXUS** = full platform (11 layers)
- **LCS** = context engine layer (`NEXUS:3`)
- **NEXUS:N** = direct layer reference (for example `NEXUS:6` = LLM Layer)

Operational checklists, dependencies, and per-layer priorities are tracked in **`NEXUS-PLAN.md`**.

## What this ecosystem actually is

This ecosystem is **not** a generic AI platform and **not** a multi-repo product suite yet.

Right now, it is:

- **one main LCS repository**
- with **five internal domains**
- centered on **context selection + teaching + durable memory**
- exposed through a **Node.js CLI**
- validated by **contracts, tests, benchmarks, and safety gates**

In practical terms, this repo already behaves like a structured ecosystem, but it is still **one product repository with clear internal boundaries**, not several independent products.

## What happens inside this ecosystem

The repository currently coordinates five concerns:

1. **Core**  
   Selects and compresses useful context, ranks chunks, and builds teaching packets.

2. **Memory + Sync**  
   Recalls durable memory, supports local fallback storage, and syncs selected knowledge outward when needed.

3. **Ops + Safety**  
   Enforces redaction, safety gates, observability, CI checks, release discipline, and benchmark quality.

4. **Runtime**  
   Exposes the CLI, command execution, config handling, and operational flow.

5. **Platform**  
   Holds the documentation, examples, benchmark fixtures, and the integrated view of the whole system.

## What this ecosystem is not

It is **not**:

- a browser product
- a full LLM serving platform
- a generic agent orchestration framework
- a repo-per-layer architecture
- an Engram clone

## Current repository strategy

The correct strategy **today** is:

- keep everything in **one LCS repo**
- keep the ecosystem **modular by internal domain**
- extract separate repos **later only if boundaries become stable**

Why this is the correct decision:

- several parts still evolve together
- `LCS CORE`, `OBSERVABILITY`, and `VERSIONING` are already strong
- `SYNC`, `PROCESSING`, `STORAGE`, and especially `LLM LAYER` are still maturing
- splitting into multiple repos now would add release and CI overhead without enough benefit

The split rationale is documented in `docs/repo-split-5-repos.md`.

## Status

This repository is actively maintained and usable for real project workflows.

Today it provides:

- context selection with noise suppression (`select`)
- teaching packet generation from real code context (`teach`)
- durable memory recall/write through Engram with degraded-mode fallbacks (`recall`, `remember`, `close`)
- versioned JSON contracts for CLI automation (`--format json`)
- CI quality gates (tests, typecheck, build, benchmarks, security checks)

## Current maturity snapshot

This is the current architectural picture of the ecosystem:

| Area | Maturity |
|---|---:|
| Sync | 60% |
| Processing | 75% |
| Storage | 75% |
| LCS Core | 92% |
| Guard | 88% |
| Orchestration | 90% |
| LLM Layer | 65% |
| Evals | 85% |
| Observability | 90% |
| Versioning | 90% |
| Interface | 75% |

Interpretation:

- the **core engine is already strong**
- the **operational quality layer is strong**
- the **LLM/platform expansion is still early**
- the ecosystem is real, but still in a **consolidation phase**

## What this project is trying to solve

- Generate code and explanations in the same loop.
- Adapt the teaching style to the active language through skills.
- Preserve useful probability mass inside the context window by filtering noise, duplicates, and stale material.
- Keep memory and prompt context separate but cooperative.

## Resumen rapido en espanol

Este proyecto es una CLI para:

- filtrar contexto antes de usar un LLM
- ensenar sobre el codigo mientras se trabaja
- recordar decisiones duraderas del proyecto

La idea no es mandar todo al modelo, sino elegir mejor:

- que codigo entra
- que test importa
- que memoria historica vale recuperar
- que ruido debe quedar afuera

## External repo decision

The primary repo to use as the architectural base is `engram`.

Why:

- it is the strongest fit for persistent memory and context retrieval
- it already thinks in terms of durable knowledge for agents
- it is a better foundation for context hygiene than a UI-first or transport-first repo

Use these other repositories as complementary references:

- `gentleman-architecture-agents` for agent contracts and scope control
- `Gentle-Learning` for the learning experience and pedagogical flow
- `Gentleman-MCP` later, if we need external tool orchestration

Full analysis lives in `docs/repo-analysis.md`.

## Exact use of Engram in this repository

This project uses **[Engram](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram)** from Gentleman-Programming **only for the durable memory layer**.

In concrete terms, Engram is used to:

- save durable project memories
- recall past decisions and summaries
- keep historical memory separate from the current prompt context

Engram is **not** used here as:

- the code-generation engine
- the context selector
- the pedagogical layer
- the general orchestration layer

## Uso exacto de Engram en espanol

En este repo usamos **Engram de Gentleman-Programming unicamente para la memoria durable**.

Se usa solo para:

- guardar memorias importantes
- recuperar decisiones previas
- traer resumenes utiles de sesiones anteriores

No se usa aqui para:

- generar codigo
- rankear chunks
- ensenar el contenido
- reemplazar la logica principal de la CLI

## Languages used in this repository

This repository is not JavaScript-only.

It currently uses:

- **JavaScript (ESM)** for the core CLI, selector, recall flow, and teaching packet logic
- **TypeScript** in the real backend vertical under `examples/typescript-backend/`
- **Markdown** for documentation, agent contracts, and skills
- **JSON** for fixtures, benchmarks, package manifests, and structured inputs
- **YAML** for GitHub Actions CI

## Runtimes and dependencies

### Core runtime

- **Node.js** is the required runtime for the main CLI
- **Engram binary** is the external memory runtime used for durable memory features such as `recall`, `remember`, and `close`

### Root package dependencies

The root package intentionally has **no external npm runtime dependencies**.

That is deliberate:

- easier local iteration
- lower installation friction
- smaller dependency surface

### Example TypeScript vertical dependencies

The TypeScript backend vertical under `examples/typescript-backend/` uses:

#### Runtime dependencies

- `zod`

#### Dev dependencies

- `typescript`
- `vitest`
- `@types/node`

### Tooling used in the repository

- **GitHub Actions** for CI
- **Git** for version control
- **Engram** for durable memory only

## Installation prerequisites

To use the project locally in a serious way, you need:

- **Node.js** for the CLI and benchmarks
- **Git** for normal development workflow
- **Engram binary** if you want durable-memory commands such as `recall`, `remember`, `close`, or memory-backed `teach`

You can still use parts of the system without Engram:

- `select`
- `readme`
- `teach --no-recall`
- `recall`, `remember`, `close` with local fallback store (`.lcs/local-memory-store.jsonl`)

## Quick start

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run init:config
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run release:check
npm run benchmark
npm run benchmark:recall
npm run benchmark:vertical
npm run security:pipeline:example
npm run api:nexus
```

`security:pipeline:example` includes a default quality gate (`min-included-findings=1`, `min-selected-teach-chunks=1`, `min-priority=0.84`).

## How to use LCS (end-to-end)

Use this flow when you want to apply LCS in a real repository:

1. Validate local setup.
2. Select high-signal context.
3. Build a teaching packet tied to changed files.
4. Persist durable decisions in memory.

### 1) Validate setup

```bash
node src/cli.js doctor --format json
```

### 2) Select context from workspace

```bash
node src/cli.js select \
  --workspace . \
  --focus "auth middleware validation order" \
  --changed-files "src/auth/middleware.ts,test/auth/middleware.test.ts" \
  --format json
```

### 3) Build teaching packet with recall

```bash
node src/cli.js teach \
  --workspace . \
  --task "Harden auth middleware" \
  --objective "Teach request-boundary validation" \
  --changed-files "src/auth/middleware.ts,test/auth/middleware.test.ts" \
  --project learning-context-system \
  --format json
```

### 4) Save durable learning

```bash
node src/cli.js remember \
  --title "Auth validation order" \
  --content "Validation runs before route handlers to fail fast and protect downstream code." \
  --project learning-context-system \
  --type decision \
  --format json
```

For operator-level guidance and JSON contract details, use:

- `docs/integration.md`
- `docs/usage.md`
- `docs/security-model.md`

## Project configuration

The CLI now auto-loads `learning-context.config.json` when present.

That file is the official place for:

- default project name
- default workspace
- selection budgets
- recall defaults
- memory automation defaults (`memory.autoRecall`, `memory.autoRemember`)
- memory backend defaults (`memory.backend`: `resilient`, `engram-only`, `local-only`)
- Engram binary and data directory paths
- LLM runtime defaults (`llm.provider`, `llm.model`, `llm.temperature`, `llm.maxTokens`)
- API auth defaults (`llm.requireAuth`, `llm.apiKeys`)
- scan safety defaults and per-project overrides
- execution safety for low-signal workspace scans (`safety.requireExplicitFocusForWorkspaceScan`, `safety.minWorkspaceFocusLength`, `safety.blockDebugWithoutStrongFocus`)

Cost control note: `teach` can auto-skip recall for low-signal requests (very short task/objective and no changed files). Add `--changed-files` or `--recall-query` when you want recall to run.

Resilience note: memory commands use a local fallback store by default when Engram is unavailable. Disable it with `--local-memory-fallback false`.

Backend note: set `memory.backend` (or `--memory-backend`) to choose runtime mode:
- `resilient` = Engram primary + local fallback
- `engram-only` = only Engram
- `local-only` = only local file store

CLI flags still win over config values when both are present.

Security note: when auto-remember is enabled for `teach`, saved memory content is sanitized (sensitive paths masked, secret-like values redacted) before writing to Engram.

To inspect the local setup:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

To generate the base config file:

```bash
npm run init:config
```

To enforce the North Star quality gate (errors prevented per task):

```bash
npm run northstar:check
```

Key `config.security` fields:

- `ignoreSensitiveFiles`
- `redactSensitiveContent`
- `ignoreGeneratedFiles`
- `allowSensitivePaths`
- `extraSensitivePathFragments`

Current `typecheck` scope is intentionally incremental: it hardens the config/bootstrap and workspace-scan layer first, instead of pretending the whole repo is already fully migrated to strict TypeScript.

## Build and TypeScript migration strategy

The repo now has two different TypeScript-related flows on purpose:

1. `npm run typecheck`
   - strict incremental safety gate for the hardened core chain
2. `npm run build`
   - emits a runnable `dist/` CLI from the current runtime without pretending every file is fully migrated

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build:smoke
npm run pack:check
npm run release:check
```

Conceptually:

- **typecheck** = where we already enforce stronger contracts
- **build** = publishable runtime output for packaging and CI smoke tests
- **pack:check** = validates `npm pack` includes required package assets before publication work

The local developer entrypoint stays `src/cli.js` for now. The `dist/` build is the bridge toward a later full `.ts` migration, not a fake claim that migration is already done.

### What "real migration" means here

In this repo, migration is considered real only when all three happen:

1. module source moves to `.ts`
2. runtime behavior is validated through `dist/`
3. package distribution uses `dist` as the executable surface

The project now enforces step (2) and step (3) through CI build + smoke and `bin` pointing to `dist/cli.js`.

Current real `.ts` migrations in `src/`:

- `src/security/secret-redaction.ts`
- `src/io/text-file.ts`
- `src/contracts/config-contracts.ts`
- `src/io/config-file.ts`
- `src/io/workspace-chunks.ts`
- `src/system/project-ops.ts`
- `src/cli/arg-parser.ts`
- `src/contracts/cli-contracts.ts`
- `src/cli/teach-command.ts`
- `src/memory/recall-queries.ts`
- `src/memory/teach-recall.ts`
- `src/memory/engram-auto-orchestrator.ts`
- `src/memory/engram-client.ts`

Compatibility note:

- Node 20/22 local runtime still uses `.js` entry modules in `src/`
- `dist/` build emits from the `.ts` migration track for packaging and CI smoke validation

## Privacy and scan policy

The workspace scanner is not a blind dump.

It currently:

- ignores high-risk credential containers such as:
  - `.env*`
  - `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.netrc`
  - `.aws/credentials`, `.docker/config.json`, `.kube/config`
  - `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ed25519`
  - `.pem`, `.key`, `.pfx`, `.crt`, `.cer`, `.tfvars`
- redacts secret-like fragments inside otherwise useful files:
  - private key blocks
  - API keys and access tokens
  - bearer tokens
  - JWT-like tokens
  - connection strings and DSNs
  - common password/secret assignments
- counts redacted files, ignored sensitive files, and redaction categories in scan statistics
- allows project-level security overrides through `learning-context.config.json`

That means the CLI now exposes not only selected context, but also **how much data was ignored, truncated, or redacted**.

Security overrides are deliberately explicit:

- use `allowSensitivePaths` only for known-safe fixtures such as examples
- use `extraSensitivePathFragments` when a repo has custom sensitive areas that should never enter context
- use `safety.requirePlanForWrite` + `--plan-approved true` to force Plan/Execute discipline in write mode
- use `safety.allowedScopePaths` to block out-of-scope changed/output paths
- use `safety.maxTokenBudget` to block over-budget token windows before execution

Security model details live in [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md).

## Open-source collaboration surfaces

To make the repository usable by others, GitHub surfaces are now explicitly wired:

- Issue templates:
  - bug report
  - feature request
  - usage question
- Pull request template with mandatory validation checklist
- CI workflow with typecheck/build/tests/benchmarks plus secret scan gate
- PR Learnings Sync workflow that can export merged PR learnings to Notion (`sync:pr-learnings`) when secrets are configured
- CodeQL workflow for JavaScript/TypeScript static analysis
- Dependabot configuration for npm and GitHub Actions updates
- Security policy in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)

## Best demo right now

The strongest current demo is the TypeScript backend middleware vertical:

```bash
npm run vertical:ts:teach
npm run vertical:ts:seed-memory
npm run vertical:ts:teach:memory
```

That flow shows:

- changed code and related tests
- controlled noise suppression
- pedagogical teaching sections
- durable memory entering the final packet

## Example usage

```bash
node src/cli.js select --input examples/auth-context.json --focus "jwt middleware expired session validation" --min-score 0.25 --format text
node src/cli.js teach --input examples/auth-context.json --task "Improve auth middleware" --objective "Teach why validation runs before route handlers" --changed-files "src/auth/middleware.ts,test/auth/middleware.test.ts" --project learning-context-system --min-score 0.25 --format text
node src/cli.js ingest-security --input examples/prowler-findings.sample.json --status-filter non-pass --output ./security-chunks.json --format text
node src/cli.js readme --workspace . --focus "learning context cli noise cancellation" --output README.LEARN.md --format text
node src/cli.js recall --project learning-context-system --query "auth middleware" --type decision --scope project --limit 5 --format text
node src/cli.js remember --title "JWT order" --content "Validation runs before route handlers." --project learning-context-system --type decision --topic architecture/auth-order --format text
node src/cli.js close --summary "Integrated recall and remember commands." --learned "Context retrieval and durable memory are different layers." --next "Connect recall to the teaching flow." --project learning-context-system --format text
node src/cli.js sync-knowledge --title "PR #39 learnings" --content "Migrated Engram adapter to TS build track." --project learning-context-system --source "pr-39" --tags "typescript,memory,engram" --notion-page-id "<page-id>" --notion-token "<token>" --format text
npm run sync:pr-learnings -- --event "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH" --dry-run true
```

## Stable JSON contract

When you use `--format json`, the CLI now returns a versioned JSON contract with:

- `schemaVersion`
- `command`
- `status`
- `degraded`
- `warnings`
- `config`
- `meta`

and then the command payload itself.

That makes the CLI safer to consume from scripts and future tooling.

## Benchmark coverage

This repo now has three benchmark layers:

- selector benchmark
- recall benchmark
- vertical benchmark

The goal is not only to say "it feels better", but to show when behavior improves or regresses.

## Initial direction

The runtime is intentionally dependency-light and runs on plain Node to keep local setup simple. The only external runtime dependency is a locally installed Engram binary for durable memory, and `teach` uses that memory automatically before building the teaching packet with a multi-query recall strategy.

## Roadmaps by area

Use `ROADMAP.md` as the index and the section roadmaps under `docs/roadmaps/` when you want the next steps split by concern instead of mixed in one list.
