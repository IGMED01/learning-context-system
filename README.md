# Learning Context System

Learning Context System is an experimental CLI for **coding with teaching, memory, and context control at the same time**.

> Spanish summary available in [README.es.md](README.es.md).

It does three things together:

1. selects useful context
2. teaches from that context
3. remembers durable decisions through Engram

## Status

This repository is **experimental but serious**.

It is already usable as:

- a local research CLI
- a context-selection prototype
- a teaching-oriented coding assistant scaffold
- a durable-memory playground backed by Engram

It is **not** yet a mature framework.

## What this project is trying to solve

- Generate code and explanations in the same loop.
- Adapt the teaching style to the active language through skills.
- Preserve useful probability mass inside the context window by filtering noise, duplicates, and stale material.
- Keep memory and prompt context separate but cooperative.

## Resumen rapido en espanol

Este proyecto es una CLI experimental para:

- filtrar contexto antes de usar un LLM
- ensenar sobre el codigo mientras se trabaja
- recordar decisiones duraderas del proyecto

La idea no es mandar todo al modelo, sino elegir mejor:

- que codigo entra
- que test importa
- que memoria historica vale recuperar
- que ruido debe quedar afuera

## External repo decision

The primary repo to use as the architectural base is `engram`.

Why:

- it is the strongest fit for persistent memory and context retrieval
- it already thinks in terms of durable knowledge for agents
- it is a better foundation for context hygiene than a UI-first or transport-first repo

Use these other repositories as complementary references:

- `gentleman-architecture-agents` for agent contracts and scope control
- `Gentle-Learning` for the learning experience and pedagogical flow
- `Gentleman-MCP` later, if we need external tool orchestration

Full analysis lives in `docs/repo-analysis.md`.

## Exact use of Engram in this repository

This project uses **[Engram](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram)** from Gentleman-Programming **only for the durable memory layer**.

In concrete terms, Engram is used to:

- save durable project memories
- recall past decisions and summaries
- keep historical memory separate from the current prompt context

Engram is **not** used here as:

- the code-generation engine
- the context selector
- the pedagogical layer
- the general orchestration layer

## Uso exacto de Engram en espanol

En este repo usamos **Engram de Gentleman-Programming unicamente para la memoria durable**.

Se usa solo para:

- guardar memorias importantes
- recuperar decisiones previas
- traer resumenes utiles de sesiones anteriores

No se usa aqui para:

- generar codigo
- rankear chunks
- ensenar el contenido
- reemplazar la logica principal de la CLI

## Languages used in this repository

This repository is not JavaScript-only.

It currently uses:

- **JavaScript (ESM)** for the core CLI, selector, recall flow, and teaching packet logic
- **TypeScript** in the real backend vertical under `examples/typescript-backend/`
- **Markdown** for documentation, agent contracts, and skills
- **JSON** for fixtures, benchmarks, package manifests, and structured inputs
- **YAML** for GitHub Actions CI

## Runtimes and dependencies

### Core runtime

- **Node.js** is the required runtime for the main CLI
- **Engram binary** is the external memory runtime used for durable memory features such as `recall`, `remember`, and `close`

### Root package dependencies

The root package intentionally has **no external npm runtime dependencies**.

That is deliberate:

- easier local iteration
- lower installation friction
- smaller dependency surface

### Example TypeScript vertical dependencies

The TypeScript backend vertical under `examples/typescript-backend/` uses:

#### Runtime dependencies

- `zod`

#### Dev dependencies

- `typescript`
- `vitest`
- `@types/node`

### Tooling used in the repository

- **GitHub Actions** for CI
- **Git** for version control
- **Engram** for durable memory only

## Acknowledgements

## Installation prerequisites

To use the project locally in a serious way, you need:

- **Node.js** for the CLI and benchmarks
- **Git** for normal development workflow
- **Engram binary** if you want durable-memory commands such as `recall`, `remember`, `close`, or memory-backed `teach`

You can still use parts of the system without Engram:

- `select`
- `readme`
- `teach --no-recall`

## Quick start

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run init:config
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run benchmark
npm run benchmark:recall
npm run benchmark:vertical
```

## Project configuration

The CLI now auto-loads `learning-context.config.json` when present.

That file is the official place for:

- default project name
- default workspace
- selection budgets
- recall defaults
- Engram binary and data directory paths

CLI flags still win over config values when both are present.

To inspect the local setup:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

To generate the base config file:

```bash
npm run init:config
```

Current `typecheck` scope is intentionally incremental: it hardens the config/bootstrap and workspace-scan layer first, instead of pretending the whole repo is already fully migrated to strict TypeScript.

## Privacy and scan policy

The workspace scanner is not a blind dump.

It currently:

- ignores high-risk credential containers such as:
  - `.env*`
  - `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.netrc`
  - `.aws/credentials`, `.docker/config.json`, `.kube/config`
  - `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ed25519`
  - `.pem`, `.key`, `.pfx`, `.crt`, `.cer`, `.tfvars`
- redacts secret-like fragments inside otherwise useful files:
  - private key blocks
  - API keys and access tokens
  - bearer tokens
  - JWT-like tokens
  - connection strings and DSNs
  - common password/secret assignments
- counts redacted files, ignored sensitive files, and redaction categories in scan statistics

That means the CLI now exposes not only selected context, but also **how much data was ignored, truncated, or redacted**.

Security model details live in [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md).

## Best demo right now

The strongest current demo is the TypeScript backend middleware vertical:

```bash
npm run vertical:ts:teach
npm run vertical:ts:seed-memory
npm run vertical:ts:teach:memory
```

That flow shows:

- changed code and related tests
- controlled noise suppression
- pedagogical teaching sections
- durable memory entering the final packet

## Example usage

```bash
node src/cli.js select --input examples/auth-context.json --focus "jwt middleware expired session validation" --min-score 0.25 --format text
node src/cli.js teach --input examples/auth-context.json --task "Improve auth middleware" --objective "Teach why validation runs before route handlers" --changed-files "src/auth/middleware.ts,test/auth/middleware.test.ts" --project learning-context-system --min-score 0.25 --format text
node src/cli.js readme --workspace . --focus "learning context cli noise cancellation" --output README.LEARN.md --format text
node src/cli.js recall --project learning-context-system --query "auth middleware" --type decision --scope project --limit 5 --format text
node src/cli.js remember --title "JWT order" --content "Validation runs before route handlers." --project learning-context-system --type decision --topic architecture/auth-order --format text
node src/cli.js close --summary "Integrated recall and remember commands." --learned "Context retrieval and durable memory are different layers." --next "Connect recall to the teaching flow." --project learning-context-system --format text
```

## Stable JSON contract

When you use `--format json`, the CLI now returns a versioned JSON contract with:

- `schemaVersion`
- `command`
- `status`
- `degraded`
- `warnings`
- `config`
- `meta`

and then the command payload itself.

That makes the CLI safer to consume from scripts and future tooling.

## Benchmark coverage

This repo now has three benchmark layers:

- selector benchmark
- recall benchmark
- vertical benchmark

The goal is not only to say "it feels better", but to show when behavior improves or regresses.

## Initial direction

The prototype is intentionally dependency-light and runs on plain Node so we can iterate even in a minimal local environment. The only external runtime it now leans on is a locally installed Engram binary for durable memory, and `teach` now uses that memory automatically before building the teaching packet with a smarter multi-query recall strategy.

## Roadmaps by area

Use `ROADMAP.md` as the index and the section roadmaps under `docs/roadmaps/` when you want the next steps split by concern instead of mixed in one list.
