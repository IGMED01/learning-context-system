## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Added parallel memory runtime with dual-provider support (`local + obsidian`) through `src/memory/parallel-memory-client.js`.
- Added Obsidian memory provider adapter (`src/memory/obsidian-memory-provider.js`) with project-scoped read/write compatibility for `remember`/`close`/`recall`/`teach`.
- Added shared advanced memory ranking module (`src/memory/memory-search-ranking.js`) for metadata gating, hybrid lexical ranking, recency weighting, path affinity scoring, and cross-provider deduplication.
- Added strict memory isolation controls (`memory.isolation`, `--memory-isolation`) and language-aware filters (`--memory-language`) across recall and teach flows.

### Changed
- Extended memory backend strategy with `parallel` mode (`--memory-backend parallel`) while keeping `resilient` and `local-only` compatibility.
- Teach auto-recall and auto-remember now propagate language/isolation context to reduce cross-language drift (for example Go knowledge surfacing during JavaScript tasks).
- Obsidian vault export/sync now uses project-first sectorization (`skills`, `tools`, `projects`, `learning-packets`, fallback `memories`) while preserving type metadata.
- Recall output now exposes isolation and provider-chain diagnostics in both text and JSON observability payloads.
- Updated doctor diagnostics for parallel mode to report Obsidian second-memory readiness.
- Marked local vault path `NEXUS/learning-context-system/` as gitignored local-only knowledge.

### Contracts
- CLI/config contracts extended additively for:
  - `memory.backend = parallel`
  - `memory.isolation = strict|relaxed`
  - language-aware memory filters/options in recall/teach/remember/close
- No breaking JSON contract change.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Added `docs/planning/nexus-plan.md` to track the full 11-layer execution checklist by phase (`FASE 1..4`) with dependencies, priorities, and completion status.
- Added NEXUS runtime layers and modules:
  - `src/processing/*` (structure parser, chunker, metadata tagger, entity extractor)
  - `src/storage/*` (chunk repository, BM25 index, hybrid retriever, vector-store interface)
  - `src/guard/*` (output guard, compliance checker, output auditor)
  - `src/llm/*` (provider registry, Claude provider, prompt builder, context injector, response parser)
  - `src/orchestration/*` (pipeline builder + default step executors)
  - `src/sync/*` (change detector, version tracker, sync scheduler)
  - `src/eval/*` (consistency scorer + CI gate)
  - `src/versioning/*` (prompt version store + rollback planner)
  - `src/api/*` (auth middleware + HTTP server endpoints)
- Added dashboard aggregation adapter `src/observability/dashboard-data.js`.
- Added local API launcher `scripts/run-nexus-api.js` and npm script `api:nexus`.

### Docs
- Clarified the repository direction: the current ecosystem is **one NEXUS repo with five internal domains**, not a multi-repo product suite yet.
- Added `docs/repo-split-5-repos.md` to explain the real split strategy: modularize first, extract later.
- Updated `README.md`, `README.es.md`, `docs/planning/roadmap.md`, and `docs/status-actual.md` so GitHub explains exactly what the ecosystem is and how mature each area is.
- Updated `docs/usage.md` with the active NEXUS API surface and auth model.
- Moved implementation plans/checklists to **local-only** artifacts (removed from GitHub tracking and public docs links).

### Performance
- Cached `focusTokens` once per `selectContextWindow` call instead of re-tokenizing per chunk, eliminating O(n) redundant tokenizations.
- Cached `chunkTokens` in `PreparedChunk.tokens` field and propagated through all `scoreChunk` call sites (initial ranking, incremental rescoring, rebalance) and Jaccard redundancy checks.
- Bounded the recall↔workspace rebalance loop to `maxChunks` iterations to prevent unbounded execution.
- Extended `Chunk` interface with optional `tokens` field and `SelectionOptions` with internal cache hints (`_cachedFocusTokens`, `_cachedChunkTokens`).

### Changed
- Workspace scanning now integrates NEXUS processing stage output (section-aware chunking, metadata tags, and entity extraction) before context selection.
- Local memory fallback store now persists through the chunk repository layer (NEXUS storage unification).
- `selectContextWindow` now supports retrieval-aware scoring (`retrievalScore`, `vectorScore`) plus custom scorer hooks.
- Output guard now includes functional `domain-scope` enforcement in addition to secret/policy checks.
- Notion sync now includes paginated child listing and delta append mode.
- Config contracts now include `llm.*` runtime/auth defaults (`provider`, `model`, `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `tokenBudget`, `maxContextChunks`, `requireAuth`, `apiKeys`).
- `npm pack` gate file-count threshold was adjusted to match the expanded NEXUS runtime distribution size.
- Added `.ts` build-track sources for memory teach orchestration (`src/memory/teach-recall.ts`, `src/memory/engram-auto-orchestrator.ts`) and wired TypeScript configs to prefer those sources during typecheck/build.
- Added `.ts` build-track source for Engram adapter execution/parsing (`src/memory/engram-client.ts`) and wired TypeScript configs to prefer it during typecheck/build.
- Added Notion team-knowledge sync command (`sync-knowledge`) that appends structured notes to a target page using token + page-id configuration.
- Added merged-PR knowledge sync automation (`scripts/sync-pr-learnings.js` + `.github/workflows/pr-learnings-sync.yml`) that transforms PR metadata into `sync-knowledge` notes with degraded skip mode when Notion secrets are missing.
- Hardened Notion config normalization so `NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID` accepts full Notion page URLs (auto-extracts page id) to avoid invalid request URL failures.
- Notion page-id normalization now converts 32-hex IDs into canonical UUID format for `/blocks/{page_id}/children` requests.
- Notion sync now retries alternate page-id formats (UUID and compact 32-hex) when Notion returns `Invalid request URL`.
- Fixed Notion append transport to use `PATCH /blocks/{page_id}/children` (was `POST`), matching the official Notion API contract.
- Notion sync now renders markdown-like note content as native Notion blocks (`heading_*`, `bulleted_list_item`, `numbered_list_item`, `paragraph`) so PR learnings are readable without raw markdown markers.
- Added npm packaging gate (`npm run pack:check`) plus CI enforcement on Node 20 to verify tarball includes required publishable assets (`package.json`, `README.md`, `dist/cli.js`).
- Added configurable task safety gate (`config.safety`) with pre-execution blocking for write-mode without plan approval, out-of-scope paths, and over-budget token windows; observability now tracks blocked/prevented events.
- `teach` now skips automatic Engram recall for low-signal tasks (very short task/objective with no `--changed-files`) to avoid unnecessary memory/token cost unless the user provides stronger signals (`--changed-files` or `--recall-query`).
- Added resilient memory fallback path: when Engram is unavailable, `recall`/`remember`/`close` (and memory-backed `teach`) can continue via local store `.lcs/local-memory-store.jsonl` with explicit degraded metadata/warnings.
- Added explicit memory backend strategy (`memory.backend` / `--memory-backend`) with `resilient` (default), `engram-only`, and `local-only` modes; `doctor` now reports backend mode and skips Engram path warnings when backend is `local-only`.
- Added formal North Star quality gate (`npm run northstar:check`) backed by observability metrics to enforce minimum prevented-error signal in CI.
- Added cost-safety enforcement for workspace scans: explicit focus requirement, minimum focus length, and weak-focus debug blocking (`safety.requireExplicitFocusForWorkspaceScan`, `safety.minWorkspaceFocusLength`, `safety.blockDebugWithoutStrongFocus`).
- `POST /api/ask` now supports `attemptTimeoutMs` and returns fallback execution telemetry (`fallback.summary`) with attempt counts, duration, token totals, and successful provider.
- Sync drift monitoring now classifies each run as `stable|warning|critical`, detects spike behavior against historical baseline, and supports threshold overrides via `GET /api/sync/drift` query params.
- Domain eval suite now supports coverage policy (`qualityPolicy.requiredDomains`, `qualityPolicy.minCasesPerDomain`) and can run through API/SDK with `POST /api/evals/domain-suite`.
- API errors now use a consistent contract (`errorCode`, `requestId`, `details`) and `x-request-id` response header; pipeline execution now exposes extended traceability (`runId`, timing summary, and per-step `attemptTrace`).
- Installation policy is now standardized on `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (README/docs/CI), and `doctor` now reports an explicit `npm install scripts policy` check so environments can verify `ignore-scripts` safety.
- Bumped package release metadata to `v0.3.0`.

### Contracts
- Added v1 compatibility fixtures/tests for all JSON CLI commands (`version`, `doctor`, `init`, `sync-knowledge`, `ingest-security`, `select`, `teach`, `readme`, `recall`, `remember`, `close`).
- Added degraded recall contract coverage for `malformed-output` classification in `recall --format json`.
- Added portable test coverage for all newly introduced NEXUS layers (`NEXUS:0..10`) including API/auth/pipeline/evals/versioning paths.
- No breaking JSON contract change.
